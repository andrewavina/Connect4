# Connect 4 Game

Play game [here](https://andrewavina.github.io/project1-game-connect4/)

# 2-Player Head to Head game
First player to have 4 tokens in a row horizontally, vertically, and/or diagonally wins the game. 

### How to Play:
Player 1 plays with Yellow tokens and Player 2 plays with Red tokens.

Choose which circle slot to place your token in by clicking on its column with your mouse. 

Once you click on the column you wish to drop your token into, the token will go to the bottom most available slot. 

The game ends when either a player has at least 4 tokens in a row a.k.a. "connects 4", or if every slot is taken up without any connect 4's - in which case the game is a draw. 


### Development & Technologies

## Approach Taken
- Began with user stories, wireframing on piece of paper, and looking at examples online
- Wrote out/psuedocoded the needed objects and JavaScript functionality that would be needed to make the game work and meet user stories.
- I started by quickly creating the HTML layout and elements for where the game board would be.
- Shortly after, moved to creating the game board and having the tokens appear on click.
- Then, focused on the hardest and most time-consuming aspect of this game which was the logic for figuring out who wins the game. 
- After getting that logic, set up the pop up to show who won and reset/play again button.
- Finishing up on keeping an ongoing track of the score and styling the game to make it look better than plain.
